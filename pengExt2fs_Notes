######    EXT2 (pengExt2)    ######
using sudo insmod pengExt2.ko to load this FS module. 
using sudo rmmod pengExt2.ko to unload. 
Check the loaded modules in kernel: lsmod | head -6

===How to format the drive to pengExt2 FS format===
sudo mkfs.ext2 -b 4096 /dev/nvme1n1 64
This will create 64 4KiB blocks with 32 inodes (with lost_found folder created.)

Initially, the defaul block size in the Super Block is 1024.
The super block index is 1 with an offset 0. 

After reading the block size saved in the disk, which is 4096. 
The FS reset the super block to be 0 with an offset 1024. 
 
Max file size is 2TiB. 
inode size is 128 Bytes. 
First non-reserved inode index is 11. 
Root inode index is 2. 

(LBA sector size is 512B)
LBA 0-1: Boot block (first 1024 bytes, LBA0-1)
LBA 2-7: Super block (second 1024 bytes, LBA2-7) 

LBA 8-15: Group descriptor. (block index 1 based on 4096 block size)  --- Data structure ext2_group_desc, which records 
    the block # of data block bitmap;
    the block # of inode bitmap;
    the block # of inode table; 

LBA 16-23: Data block bitmap (to be confirmed)
LBA 24-31: inode bitmap (to be confirmed)
LBA 32-39: inode table (Starting from Block 4)
LBA 40-: data blocks (Starting from Block 5)

===How to mount the drive to pengExt2 FS===
